# Protocol Summary
PasswordStore is a protocol dedicated to the storage and retrieval of a userâ€™s passwords. The protocol is designed for single-user functionality, where only the owner should be able to set and access the password.

# Disclaimer
The CodeFortis team makes all efforts to identify vulnerabilities within the given time frame but does not hold responsibility for findings documented in this report. This audit solely focuses on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation.

# Risk Classification
| Likelihood | High Impact | Medium Impact | Low Impact |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **High**   | H           | H/M           | M          |
| **Medium** | H/M         | M             | M/L        |
| **Low**    | M           | M/L           | L          |

The severity matrix follows the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) methodology.

# Audit Details
## Scope
The findings in this document correspond to the commit hash:  
**`2e8f81e263b3a9d18fab4fb5c46805ffc10a9990`**

# Findings
## High Severity
### [H-1] Password is Publicly Accessible
**Description:** All data store on-chain is visible to to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` varaible is intended to be a private variable and only accessed throught the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended to be only called by the owner of the contract.

I show one such method of reading any data off chain below.

**Impact:** Anyone is able to read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:** (Proof of Code)
The below test case shows that anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain
1. Create a locally running chain

```bash
make anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain.

``` bash
make deploy
```

3. Run the storage tool.
I made use of `1` because it is the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract

``` bash
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
You will get an output like this

0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014

You can the parse the hex into a string with
``` bash
cast parse-bytes32-string
0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```
And get an output of:
``` bash
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the stored password. However, you're also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with this decryption key. 

**Likelihood & Impact**

- Impact: HIGH
- Likelihood: HIGH
- Severity: HIGH

### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` has no access control, meaning a non-owner can change the password

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however the purpose of the smart contract and function's natspec indicate that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

``` javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
    @>      // @audit - No access controls
            s_password = newPassword;
            emit SetNetPassword();
        }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can `set or change` the stored password, severly breaking the contract's intended functionality

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test file.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

``` javascript
    function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
            vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
            vm.startPrank(randomAddress);
            string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
            passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
            vm.startPrank(owner);
            string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
            assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
        }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control conditional to `PasswordStore::setPassword`.

```javascript
    if(msg.sender != s_owner){
        revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
    }
```

**Likelihood & Impact**

- Impact: HIGH
- Likelihood: HIGH
- Severity: HIGH

## Informational
### [I-1] TITLE `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspec indicates a parameter that doesn't exist, causing the natspec to be incorrect.

**Description:**

``` javascript
    /*
    * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
@>  * @param newPassword The new password to set.
    */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {}
```

The `PasswordStore::getPassword` function signature is `getPassword()` while the natspec says it should be `getPassword(string)`.

**Impact** The natspec is incorrect

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line

```diff
/*
*@notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
- *@param newPassword The new password to set.
*/
```

**Likelihood & Impact**

- Impact: HIGH
- Likelihood: NONE
- Severity: INFORMATIONAL/NON-CRITICAL

## Recommendations
- Introduce access control for sensitive functions.
- Avoid storing sensitive data like plaintext passwords directly on-chain.
- Review all NatSpec comments for accuracy.

# Conclusion
The report highlights key vulnerabilities in the PasswordStore protocol and provides actionable recommendations to improve security and functionality.
